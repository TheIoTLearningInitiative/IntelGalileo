Intel® Galileo
==

> Intel Galileo is the first in a line of Arduino-certified development boards based on Intel x86 architecture and is designed for the maker and education communities. Intel released two versions of Galileo, referred to as Gen 1 and Gen 2. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Galileo)

> The Intel® Galileo Gen 2 development board is a microcontroller board based on the Intel® Quark™ SoC X1000 application processor, a 32-bit Intel® Pentium® brand system on a chip (SoC). It is the first board based on Intel® architecture designed to be hardware and software pin-compatible with shields designed for the Arduino Uno* R3.
